            <h1>Essie</h1>
            <p>Today the Essie manicure is synonymous with quality and style all over the world, but did ysou know the history behind this famous beauty brand? Believe it or not, this world famous nail polish range began life in Las Vegas as a collection of just 12 shades. Find out about the vision of the woman who created it; how the brand grew to over 200 fashionable shades today.  All the nail polish is the creation of Essie Weingarten, who had a successful career as a fashion buyer but dreamt of following her passion for beauty and in particular, glamorous nails. In the early 1980s, nail salons offered very few choices as far as working women were concerned. When having beautiful hands mattered, there simply weren't the wide range of fashionable shades we all enjoy today. Weingarten created 12 new chip-resistant colours and began selling them to Las Vegas hotel nail salons. The Essie manicure was an instant hit.</p>
