    <h1>Manicure Tips</h1>
    
    <ul>
        <li><b>Whitening Yellow Nails</b>: Prolonged use of dark nail polish colors can cause nails to turn yellow. Brush a paste of lemon juice with baking soda onto your nails to get rid of the stains.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Avoid Bubbles in Your Nail Polish</b>: All it takes is one little bubble to ruin a great manicure.  Wait for the first coat to dry completely before applying to second to avoid bubbles.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>How to Strengthen Fingernails</b>: Healthy and strong finger nails reflect how well we take care of our nails and hands. Weak and brittle fingernails are most often due to neglect. By protecting fingernails from environmental damage and taking time to moisturize nails, anyone can have stronger fingernails.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>How and Why to Use a Base Coat</b>: When you're applying polish, a base coat serves as an adhesive between the color and the nail. A topcoat provides shine and prevents chipping but does not have that adhesive effect. If you want something that does it all, look for a multipurpose clear coat that is labeled for use as both a base and a topcoat.  If you simply want shiny, natural-looking nails, use a topcoat and lose the base coat. If you're applying colored polish, use each for its intended purpose.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Remove Oils From The Nail Before Polishing</b>: It's important to wipe nails with a nail polish remover before applying polish even if you don't have nail polish to remove. Oils left on the nail (like the hand cream or lip balm) will keep polish from sticking.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>How To Deal With Smudges and Stains</b>: Smudged your polish while painting? Try this trick: dip your finger in nail polish remover and use it to smooth the surface, repainting with a topcoat. The secret to keeping nails from smudging is proper drying time. Surfaces will feel dry to the touch after 10 minutes, but don't be fooled. It actually takes an entire hour for nails to completely dry.  Fingers stained from nicotine, berries or too dark polish can be fixed with whitening toothpaste like Rembrandt. Then brush the skin or nails with a toothbrush.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>How Teal With A Broken or Torn Nail</b>:When a nail breaks, the best thing to do is to cut it off. But here's a trick if the break is low down (and painful, undoubtedly): cut a tiny strip of gauze from a teabag, place it over the tear and the paint over with polish.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>How To Maintain Fresh Polish</b>: Keep your mani/pedi looking fresh by adding a new layer of topcoat every other day. A proper manicure should last 1 to 2 weeks. A pedicure should last 2 to 4.</li>
        <br />
        <li><b>Wrap The Tips of Your Nail Polish</b>: When applying polish, be sure to bring it over the front edge of the nail and slightly under the tip. This helps prevent chipping.  When polishing, 2 thin coats are better than one thick coat. You'll find it dries faster. If the polish chips, it's best to remove the paint from the nail and start over. If you don't have time, dip your finger in nail polish remover and smooth over the chipped area and re-apply a topcoat.</li>
        <li><b>Choose The Shortest Nail to Cut By</b>:Not sure how short to clip nails? Choose the shortest nail as your guide. Once you've clipped, line each finger up with its opposite, cuticle-to-cuticle, to ensure you cut short enough.</li>
    </ul>
